1 Now the main point in what we are saying is this:we do have this kind of high priest,
who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven 2 and who serves in the sanctuary,
the true tabernacle set up by the Lord and not by any human.
3 For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices.
Therefore, this high priest a had to offer something too.
4 Now if he were on earth, he would not even be a priest, because other men offer the gifts prescribed by the law.
5 They serve in a sanctuary that is a copy, a shadow of the heavenly one.
This is why Moses was warned when he was about to build the tabernacle:
"See to it that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown you on the mountain
(Hebrews 8:1-5 ISV)
