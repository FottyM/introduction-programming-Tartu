Exercise 2. Number of days in months
Rewrite the number of days in months program from week 4 so that the program would read dates in form dd.mm.yyyy
from file that looks like this (ask filename from user),
pick up the number of month from each line and print out the number of days in this month.
Rewrite your function that it would not contain conditional (if) statements for getting the number of days.
Your function should do it using a list.
Do not check for leap year (letâ€™s say that number of days in february is always 28).
